# User Interface Technology (UIT)

Welcome to the repository for **NDAK16008U - User Interface Technology (UIT)**, a 7.5 ECTS course offered by the University of Copenhagen as part of the MSc Programme in Computer Science.

## Course Overview

The UIT course explores modern and emerging user interface technologies with a strong emphasis on **physical computing**. It combines theoretical insights with hands-on practical experience to equip students with the ability to build novel user interfaces and understand the research behind them.

### Key Topics
- **Theoretical Foundations**
  - Classic and modern interaction paradigms (e.g., GUIs, gesture-based interaction)
  - Predictive models of user performance
  - Physical interaction models and theories
- **Emerging Technologies**
  - Sensor-based interfaces
  - Tangible and shape-changing interfaces
  - Interactive 3D-printed objects

### Practical Skills
- 3D modeling and printing
- Microcontroller programming
- Circuit prototyping (basic and advanced)
- Machine learning applied to novel interfaces
- Soldering and hardware fabrication

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion, students will have:

**Knowledge of:**
- Classic and contemporary research in UI technology
- Interaction models and research evaluation methods
- Benefits and trade-offs of various UI technologies

**Skills in:**
- Locating and understanding recent research
- Designing and building innovative software/hardware UI prototypes

**Competences in:**
- Developing interfaces based on research
- Critically analyzing UI technology choices

## Course Format

- **Lectures:** 16 hours
- **Lab Exercises:** 32 hours
- **Project Work:** 108 hours
- **Preparation:** 32 hours
- **Exam:** 18 hours

The course alternates between paper discussions and lab-based prototype development.

## Assessment

- **60%** Group Project Report (must be passed independently)
- **40%** Written 4-hour On-Site Exam (must be passed independently)

All aids are permitted for the project. The exam allows all aids **except** generative AI tools and internet access.

## Requirements

- Programming proficiency equivalent to a BSc in Computer Science
- Willingness to experiment, prototype, and critically engage with UI technologies
